CernVM supports VirtualBox, VMware, Xen, KVM and Microsoft Hyper-V hypervisors. Each new release of a CernVM image needs to be thoroughly tested with all of them. Although the test cases are not many (about 20 tests) the large overall number of hypervisor/host OS/Virtual Machine edition combinations makes the process very time consuming.

The intent of this project is to develop a program which will install and configure CernVM instances, run the set of tests and report the results.
